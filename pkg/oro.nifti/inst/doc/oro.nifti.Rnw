\section{Introduction}

The \pkg{oro.nifti} package requires incoming data to be in the
ANALYZE~7.5 or NIfTI formats.  Data acquisition and input (e.g., from
DICOM using \pkg{oro.dicom}) must be performed by the user before
\pkg{oro.nifti} may be used to summarize the data.  Several software
packages allow DICOM-to-NIfTI (or ANALYZE) conversion; e.g.,
\begin{itemize}
\item oro.dicom (\url{rigorous.r-forge.r-project.org})
\item FreeSurfer (\url{surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu})
\item Xmedcon (\url{xmedcon.sourceforge.net})
\item MRIConvert (\url{lnci.oregon.edu/\~jolinda/MRIConvert})
\end{itemize}
This is by no means an exhaustive list of software available for DICOM
conversion.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{A Note on Axes and Orientation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The NIfTI format contains an implicit generalized spatial
transformation from the data co-ordinate system $(i,j,k)$ into a
real-space ``right-handed'' co-ordinate system.  In this real-space
system, the $(x,y,z)$ axes are \emph{usually} set such that $x$
increases from left to right, $y$ increases from posterior to anterior
and $z$ increases from inferior to superior.

At this point in time the \pkg{oro.nifti} package cannot apply an
arbitrary transform to the imaging data into $(x,y,z)$ space -- such a
transform may require non-integral indices and interpolation steps.
The package does accommodate straightforward transformations of imaging
data; e.g., setting the $x$-axis to increase from right to left
(neurological).  Future versions of \pkg{oro.nifti} will attempt to
address more complicated transformations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{NIfTI and ANALYZE data in S4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A major improvement in the \pkg{oro.nifti} package is the fact that
standard medical imaging formats are stored in unique classes under
the S4 system.  Essentially, NIfTI and ANALYZE data are stored as
multi-dimensional arrays with extra slots created that capture the
format-specific header information.  The NIfTI class also has the
ability to read and write extensions that conform to the data format
standard.  Customized printing and validity-checking functions are
available to the user and every attempt is made to ensure that the
information from the multi-dimensional array is in agreement with the
header values.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Audit Trail}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Following on from the S4 implementation of both the NIfTI and Analyze
data formats, the ability to extend the NIfTI data format header is
utilized in the \pkg{oro.nifti} package.  First, extensions are
properly handled when reading and writing NIfTI data.  Second, users
are allowed to add extensions to newly-created NIfTI objects using
various functions and the \pkg{XML} package.  Third, by default all
operations that are performed on a NIfTI object will generate what we
call an \emph{audit trail} that consists of an XML-based log.  Each
log entry contains information not only about the function applied to
the NIfTI object, but also various system-level information; e.g.,
version of \proglang{R}, user name, date, time, etc.  When writing
NIfTI-class objects to disk, the XML-based NIfTI extension is
converted into plain text and saved appropriately (ecode = 6).  The
user may control the tracking of data manipulation via the audit trail
using a global option.  For example please use the command

<<niftiAuditTrail,eval=FALSE>>=
options(niftiAuditTrail=FALSE)
@

to turn off the ``audit trail'' option in \pkg{oro.nifti}.

Interactive visualization of multidimensional arrays, stored in NIfTI
or Analyze format, is best performed outside of \proglang{R} at this
point in time.  Popular viewers, especially for brain imaging, are
\begin{itemize}
\item FSLView (\url{http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslview/})
\item MRIcroN (\url{http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/MRicron/})
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Examples}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Labelled LR Standard (MNI152) Images in NIfTI Format}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The first example of reading in, and displaying, medical imaging data
in NIfTI format (\texttt{avg152T1\_LR\_nifti.nii.gz}) was obtained
from the NIfTI website (\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).  
Successful execution of the command:

<<avg152T1_LR_nifti>>=
mni.LR <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/mfniLR.nii.gz", package="oro.nifti"))
mni.LR
audit.trail(mni.LR)
descrip(mni.LR)
@ 
<<figure1-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="avg152T1_LR_nifti.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure1-code>>=
image(mni.LR)
@ 
<<figure1-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

produces a 4D array of the image data, with the default NIfTI axes,
and is displayed on a $10{\times}10$ grid of images
(Figure~\ref{fig:avg152T1_LR_nifti}).  Note, the \code{image} function
has been modified to accept \code{nifti} and \code{anlz} objects and
display them with minimal user input.  Two accessor functions are also
shown here: \code{audit.trail} and \code{descrip}.  The former is used
to access the XML-based audit trail that is stored as a NIfTI header
extension and the latter is the name of a valid NIfTI header field
(allowed to store up to 80 characters).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  \caption{Axial slices of MNI volume \texttt{avg152T1\_LR\_nifti}
  stored in radiological convention.}
  \label{fig:avg152T1_LR_nifti}
\end{figure}

The second example of reading in, and displaying, medical imaging data
in NIfTI format (\texttt{avg152T1\_RL\_nifti.nii}) was also obtained
from the NIfTI website (\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).
Successful execution of the command

<<avg152T1_RL_nifti>>=
mni.RL <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/mniRL.nii.gz", package="oro.nifti"))
mni.RL
@ 
<<figure2-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="avg152T1_RL_nifti.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure2-code>>=
image(mni.RL)
<<figure2-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

produces a 4D array of the image data that may be displayed in a
$10{\times}10$ grid of images (Figure~\ref{fig:avg152T1_RL_nifti}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{avg152T1_RL_nifti.png}
  \caption{Axial slices of MNI volume \texttt{avg152T1\_RL\_nifti}
  stored in neurological convention.}
  \label{fig:avg152T1_RL_nifti}
\end{figure}

The first image (LR) is stored in radiological convention.  The second
image (RL) is stored in neurological convention.  Any NIfTI-1 compliant
viewing software should display these images identically.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Simple Time-series or Multi-volume Image}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is an example of reading in, and displaying, a four-dimensional
medical imaging data set in NIfTI format
(\texttt{filtered\_func\_data.nii}) obtained from the NIfTI website
(\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).  Successful execution of the
command

<<filtered_func_data>>=
ffd <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/ffd.nii.gz", package="oro.nifti"))
ffd
@ 
<<figure3-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="ffd.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure3-code>>=
image(ffd)
@ 
<<figure3-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

produces a four-dimensional (4D) array of imaging data that may be
displayed in a $5{\times}5$ grid of images (Figure~\ref{fig:ffd}).
The first three dimensions are spatial locations of the voxel (volume
element) and the fourth dimension is time.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{ffd.png}
  \caption{Axial slices of the functional MRI ``volume''
  \texttt{filtered\_func\_data} from the first acquisition.}
  \label{fig:ffd}
\end{figure}

An additional graphical display function has been added for
\code{nifti} and \code{anlz} objects that allows orthographic displays.

<<figure3b-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="ffd_orthographic.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure3b-code>>=
orthographic(ffd)
@ 
<<figure3b-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{ffd_orthographic.png}
  \caption{Orthographic display of the first volume from the
  functional MRI dataset \texttt{filtered\_func\_data}.  By default
  the mid-axial, mid-saggittal and mid-coronal planes are chosen.}
  \label{fig:ffd-orthographic}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Statistic Image}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is an example of reading in and displaying a statistical image so
that it may be overlayed on the EPI (echo planar imaging) data taken
from the functional MRI experiment.  The original NIfTI files
(\texttt{filtered\_func\_data.nii} and \texttt{zstat1.nii}) were
obtained from the NIfTI website (\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).
Successful execution of the command

<<zstat1>>=
zstat1 <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/zstat1.nii.gz", package="oro.nifti"))
zstat1
@ 
<<figure4-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png("ffd_zstat1.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure4-code>>=
overlay(ffd, ifelse(abs(zstat1) > 5, zstat1, NA), zlim.y=range(zstat1))
<<figure4-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 
produces a 4D array of parameter estimates (essentially coefficients
from a linear regression performed at each voxel) that may be
overlayed on the original data for anatomical reference
(Figure~\ref{fig:zstat1}).  The function \code{overlay} extends the
capabilities of displaying ``images'' by allowing one to add a
statistical image to an underlying structural image.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{ffd_zstat1.png}
  \caption{Axial slices of the functional MRI data with 
  with the statistical image overlayed.  The test statistics were
  thresholded at $|Z|\geq{5}$.}
  \label{fig:zstat1}
\end{figure}

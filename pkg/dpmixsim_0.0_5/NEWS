Changes in dpmixsim version 0.0-5

	o	Initialisation of the simulation may be performed with any number 
		of clusters between 1 and n (vector data dimension).

	o	Simulation now estimates one variance per cluster.

	o	Simulation runtime have been reduced by more than 40%, based on code
    optimizations. 

  o Argument "minvar" has been added to dpmixsim() to control
    the minimum admissible cluster variance estimate.

	o	Reversed the order of the steps in "src/gibbsclustersamplealpha.cc".
		Re-sampling steps are now performed before cluster management.

	o	Introduced "testMarronWand" demo to test dpmixsim discriminating power.

  o postdpmixciz() has been modified to go with the changes.

	o	Bug fixed: sampling theta in birth of "newcluster".

First version released on CRAN: 0.0-3
